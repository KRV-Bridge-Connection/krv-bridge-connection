### 1. Logo Integrity
- Use the KRV Bridge Connection logo **only as provided**. **Do not alter colors, fonts, or aspect ratios**.
- Do not add effects (e.g., shadows, gradients) or modify the logo design in any way.
- The logo can only be **scaled**, no other modifications are allowed.

### 2. Font and Color Consistency
- Always use the fonts and colors as they appear in the logo files provided. **Do not substitute or alter fonts or colors**.
- The official colors are `#fafafa` (white) and `#1a5fb4` (blue). The primary logo is blue on a white background, and the inverted version uses white on a blue background.

### 3. Usage Context
- The logo may be used for promoting the KRV Bridge Connection, events the organization is partnering on, or as a direct reference to the organization.
- **Do not imply partnerships or endorsements** that have not been formally established.
- Avoid associating the brand with any products or services. **Do not place the logo on top of or adjacent to any products.**

### 4. Selection Guidance
- Choose the version of the logo (color or monochrome) that best suits your material. Ensure **visibility and contrast** against backgrounds.
- The square version has a filled background, suitable for most uses. The wide version lacks a background and should only be used on solid colors with sufficient contrast.

### 5. Clear Space and Sizing
- Maintain a minimum of **1.5em (character)** margins around the logo to ensure clarity and prevent blending with other elements.
- Avoid resizing the logo below the minimum size for readability.

### 6. Logo Placement Priority
- The logo can be placed flexibly in designs but should be included with other logos at the **same size (height)**.
- Prefer placing the KRV Bridge Connection logo near other logos with similar aspect ratios and categories when multiple logos are used.

### 7. File Formats
- **Vector formats (SVG, EPS)** are preferred where possible. A **PNG** version is also available for use.
- **Use vector formats for scalable graphics, particularly for large print or high-res needs**.

### 8. Digital Media and Event Materials
- The logo should not be altered and must be displayed with proper margins.
- Do not place the logo on top of or adjacent to any products in digital or print materials.

### 9. Restricted Usage
- The logo is not to be used for non-event purposes unless for direct references to the KRV Bridge Connection (e.g., as an icon on a map or in an article about the organization).
